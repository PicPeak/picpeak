- ⚠️ **Verify locally** - Feature-flagged off by default. Seeded contracts, QR/IBAN and tax defaults are **examples only** — review your own legal **and tax** regulations first (see disclaimers below)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get PicPeak running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PicPeak/picpeak.git
cd picpeak

# Copy the environment template — the defaults work out of the box.
# Machine secrets (JWT, DB, Redis) are auto-generated on first run, and the
# admin account is created in the browser (see below). Edit .env only to
# customise (domain, SMTP, storage paths, …) — nothing is required.
cp .env.example .env

# Start with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### First run — create your admin account

On first start with no `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set, PicPeak has **no admin account yet** and greets you with an in-browser setup screen — no credentials in `.env`:

1. Open **http://localhost:3000/admin** — you'll be redirected to `/setup`.
2. Grab the **one-time setup token** from the backend logs (it's also saved to `data/SETUP_TOKEN`):
   ```bash
   docker compose logs backend | grep -i "setup token"
   ```
3. Paste the token, set your admin **email + password**, and you're in. The token is single-use, and the setup screen closes permanently once an admin exists.

> Prefer the old behaviour? Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` and PicPeak auto-creates the admin on first boot instead (credentials written to `data/ADMIN_CREDENTIALS.txt`).

Note on Docker file permissions
- The backend container starts as root, chowns bind-mounted host directories (`./storage`, `./data`, `./logs`) to UID 1001 (`nodejs`), then drops privileges via `su-exec` before running the app. No host-side setup needed for fresh installs.
- If you pin `user:` in a compose override (e.g. to map a specific host UID), the self-chown is skipped and you must pre-chown the host directories to that UID — see [docs.picpeak.app/deployment/docker#permissions](https://docs.picpeak.app/deployment/docker#permissions).

**ARM64 (aarch64) systems:** Pre-built images include native `linux/arm64`, no platform flags or emulation needed. If you're on an older image tag that's still amd64-only, see [docker-compose.amd64.override.yml](docker-compose.amd64.override.yml) for a transitional fallback.

## 🔄 Release Channels

PicPeak offers two release channels for different needs. Stable promotions are cut from a known-good beta point every 4–6 weeks — see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the maintainer's promotion criteria and cadence policy.

### Stable Channel (Recommended)
- Production-ready releases
- Thoroughly tested before release
- Docker tags: `stable`, `latest`, or specific version like `v2.3.0`

### Beta Channel
- Early access to new features
- May contain bugs or incomplete functionality
- Docker tags: `beta` or specific version like `v2.3.0-beta.1`

### Switching Channels

Set the `PICPEAK_CHANNEL` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
# For stable releases (default)
PICPEAK_CHANNEL=stable

# For beta releases
PICPEAK_CHANNEL=beta

# For a specific version
PICPEAK_CHANNEL=v2.3.0
```

Then update your containers:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

### Update Notifications

The admin dashboard automatically notifies you when updates are available for your channel. To disable update checks, set:

```bash
UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED=false
```

## 🌐 Public Landing Page

Spotlight your studio with a customizable marketing page at `/`:

- Head to **Admin → CMS Pages** to enable the public landing page toggle.
- Edit the provided HTML template (rich sections, hero, testimonials) and optional CSS overrides.
- The preview renders in a sandboxed iframe so you can iterate safely before publishing.
- PicPeak sanitizes stored HTML and CSS server-side—scripts, iframes, and unsafe attributes are stripped automatically.
- Use **Reset to default** anytime to restore the bundled template.
- The backend caches the rendered landing page for 60 seconds by default; override with `PUBLIC_SITE_CACHE_TTL_MS` if you need a different TTL.
- When the landing page is disabled PicPeak continues to serve the admin SPA/login exactly as before.

## 🎯 Use Cases

Perfect for:
- 💒 **Wedding Photographers** - Share ceremony photos securely
- 🎂 **Event Photography** - Birthday parties, corporate events
- 📸 **Portrait Studios** - Client galleries with download limits
- 🏢 **Corporate Events** - Internal photo sharing with branding
- 🎓 **School Photography** - Secure parent access with expiration
- 📽️ **Live Events** - Put a [Live Slideshow](docs/live-slideshow.md) on the venue projector that updates as you shoot

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Storage**: Local filesystem (default) or S3-compatible object store (AWS S3, MinIO, R2, B2, Wasabi, Spaces) — see [Storage Backends](#storage-backends)
- **Email**: SMTP with customizable templates
- **Analytics**: Privacy-focused with Umami integration

## 💾 Storage Backends

PicPeak supports two storage backends for photos, thumbnails, hero images, watermarks, and archive zips. Both are configured via environment variables; no code change is required to switch.

| Capability | `STORAGE_BACKEND=local` (default) | `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` |
|---|---|---|
| Photo / thumbnail / hero storage | Local filesystem under `STORAGE_PATH` | Bucket on any S3-compatible service |
| Admin UI upload | ✅ | ✅ |
| Filesystem auto-import (chokidar watcher) | ✅ | ❌ — disabled (use the upload API) |
| Watermarks, fingerprinting, fragmentation | ✅ | ✅ (materialized to a tmp file just-in-time) |
| Bulk download zips (cached + on-the-fly) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Backups | ✅ | ✅ |
| External media reference mode (`EXTERNAL_MEDIA_ROOT`) | ✅ (always local) | ✅ (still local — not migrated) |

### Switching to an S3-compatible backend

1. Provision a bucket and credentials. The minimum IAM policy is documented in `.env.example`.
2. Set `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` plus `STORAGE_S3_BUCKET`, `STORAGE_S3_REGION`, `STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `STORAGE_S3_SECRET_KEY`. For non-AWS providers (MinIO, R2, B2, …) also set `STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT`.
3. If you have existing local content, copy it first: `node backend/scripts/migrate-storage.js --dry-run` then `node backend/scripts/migrate-storage.js`. The script is idempotent and writes a failures CSV.
4. Restart the backend. The startup check pings the bucket and refuses to boot on misconfig.

Note: presigned-URL serving (zero-bandwidth direct downloads from S3) is intentionally **not** in v1 — every request still streams through the backend so watermarks, devtools-detection, and access logging keep working.

## 🔔 Webhooks

PicPeak POSTs event/photo lifecycle notifications to URLs you configure under **Settings → Webhooks**. Each delivery is signed `HMAC-SHA256` with a per-webhook secret in the `X-PicPeak-Signature` header so receivers can verify the request really came from your PicPeak instance.

### Event types

| Event | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `event.created` | Gallery created (admin or API) |
| `event.published` | Draft becomes live (`is_draft: true → false`) — also fires when an event is created with `is_draft=false` |
| `event.archived` | Bulk-archive, manual archive, or auto-archive on expiry |
| `event.expired` | Expiration checker marks the gallery inactive (fires before `event.archived` in the cascade) |
| `photo.uploaded` | Admin upload, API upload, guest upload, or auto-import |
| `photo.deleted` | Single delete, bulk delete (NOT fired per-photo when an event is archived — receivers infer from `event.archived` to avoid flooding) |

### Payload shape

```json
{
  "id": "delivery-uuid",
  "type": "event.published",
  "created_at": "2026-04-28T05:25:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "event": { "id": 123, "slug": "wedding-smith", "share_url": "https://..." }
  }
}
```

Also sent on every request:
- `X-PicPeak-Signature` — `HMAC-SHA256(secret, raw_body)` as hex
- `X-PicPeak-Event` — the event type (handy for routing without parsing the body)
- `X-PicPeak-Delivery` — UUID for idempotency on the receiver side
- `User-Agent: PicPeak-Webhooks/1.0`

### Verifying signatures

**Node.js**
```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
function verify(secret, rawBody, signature) {
  const expected = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex');
  const a = Buffer.from(expected, 'hex');
  const b = Buffer.from(signature, 'hex');
  if (a.length !== b.length) return false;
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}
```

**Python**
```python
import hmac, hashlib
def verify(secret: str, raw_body: bytes, signature: str) -> bool:
    expected = hmac.new(secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)
```

**curl + openssl** (one-liner for a quick replay)
```sh
SIG=$(printf '%s' "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$SECRET" | awk '{print $2}')
[ "$SIG" = "$RECEIVED_SIG" ] && echo OK || echo MISMATCH
```

### Retries + observability

- `2xx` → success, recorded with latency
- Non-`2xx` or network error → exponential backoff: `1m → 5m → 30m → 2h → 12h`, max 5 attempts
- After max attempts: status `failed`, surfaces in **Settings → Webhooks → Deliveries** with a "Replay" button
- Up to 5 deliveries in flight at once; one slow consumer can't block others (configurable via `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_CONCURRENCY`)
- Response body truncated to 1KB before storage so chatty receivers don't bloat the audit log

The deliveries page (`/admin/webhooks/:id/deliveries`) shows every attempt with timestamp, status, HTTP code, latency, payload sent, signature, and response. Click "Send test event" to fire a synthetic delivery for any event type.

### SSRF protection

Webhook URLs are validated against the same private-IP blocklist used elsewhere in the app — loopback, private RFC1918 ranges, link-local, `.local`/`.internal` hostnames, cloud metadata endpoints. The check runs both at create time and per-delivery (DNS-rebinding mitigation).

For local development with a receiver on the same machine or docker network, set `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS=true`. Production deployments must leave this OFF.

## 💻 System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: 2 CPU cores
- **RAM**: **4 GB minimum** for a normal photo-upload workload — sharp/libvips
  decodes the full uncompressed frame before resize, and the default two
  worker loops at sharp-concurrency 2 can push peak RSS past 1.5 GB on a
  batch of 20-MP+ photos. On a 2 GB VPS that's enough to OOM-kill the
  backend mid-batch (surfaces as 503s on thumbnails — see [Low-memory
  hosts](#low-memory-hosts) below for the recipe to run on 2 GB).
- **Storage**: 20GB minimum (plus photo storage needs)
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), macOS, or Windows with WSL2
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **Database**: SQLite (included) or PostgreSQL 12+

### Docker Requirements (Recommended)
- **Docker**: v20.10.0+
- **Docker Compose**: v2.0.0+

### Low-memory hosts

Running on 2 GB RAM (e.g. an entry-level VPS) is workable but requires
tuning the upload-processor concurrency down. The backend auto-detects
total RAM at startup via `os.totalmem()` — on a host that reports < 3 GB,
it defaults `UPLOAD_PROCESSOR_CONCURRENCY` to **1** instead of 2 and logs
a one-shot warning. You can pin the value explicitly in `.env`:

```env
# Single worker loop — slower batch processing, lower peak RSS
UPLOAD_PROCESSOR_CONCURRENCY=1
```

The trade-off is throughput: a single worker processes one photo at a
time, so a 100-photo batch takes ~2× as long but won't OOM. **Health-check
note**: if the backend dies under memory pressure, the gallery serves
`503 Service Unavailable` on thumbnails until Docker's
`restart: unless-stopped` brings the container back. Persistent 503s
during/after an upload batch on a low-memory host are almost always this.

### Video Support Requirements
When enabling video uploads, consider these additional resources:

| Resource | Recommendation | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **RAM** | 4GB+ recommended | FFmpeg processing requires more memory |
| **Storage** | Plan for 10-100x more | Videos are significantly larger than images |
| **CPU** | Additional cores help | Video thumbnail extraction is CPU-intensive |
| **Bandwidth** | Higher throughput | Video streaming requires more bandwidth |

**Technical Notes:**
- FFmpeg is bundled via npm (`@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg`) - no system installation required
- Maximum upload size: **10GB per video file**
- Chunked upload support for files >100MB (resumable uploads)
- Supported formats: MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI
- Video thumbnails are automatically generated from the first few seconds

**For Nginx/Reverse Proxy:**
If using Nginx, increase the client max body size:
```nginx
client_max_body_size 10G;
proxy_read_timeout 3600;
proxy_send_timeout 3600;
```

## ⚠️ CRM & Accounting disclaimers — examples only, verify locally

The CRM & accounting modules (contracts, invoices, QR-bills, the tax
report and the accountant exports) ship seeded content and computed
figures that are intended as a **starting point only**:

- **Contract blocks** (image rights, NDA, model release, cancellation,
  jurisdiction, …) are written by the maintainer, **not by a lawyer**.
  Every operator must have their lawyer review and adapt them before
  sending any contract to a customer.
- **QR-bills and SEPA EPC payloads** are rendered from the data you
  typed. Picpeak is open source — please scan a test invoice with your
  bank's app to check the QR actually works. We are not responsible for
  any mistakes that come from sending an invoice with bad data on it.
- **Tax, VAT & accounting figures** (the tax report, VAT-payable, the
  per-rate breakdown, the Treuhänder / Banana export, etc.) are computed
  from the data you enter and the defaults you configure. They are
  **guidance only and jurisdiction-specific** — tax rules, VAT rates,
  deduction schemes (e.g. the Liechtenstein 20 % Gewinnungskosten flat
  rate) and filing duties differ by country and change over time. **Every
  operator must check their own tax / VAT regulations and verify the
  numbers with their accountant / Treuhänder / tax authority before
  relying on any figure or export.** Picpeak makes no warranty that the
  output is correct for your jurisdiction or situation.
